It is always a learning journey with CSS, as there are many "edge cases" and they are often infuriating to resolve.

> _Why does it behave this way? How could I have known this?!_

I chanced upon this unexpected behavior when I was trying to write a responsive tabs component.  
To be explicit, I want to design my component to:

- Grow as much as you need, up to your `max-width`
- But if your parent is smaller than your `max-width`, then your parent's `width` **is** your `max-width`

## Demo

Try resizing the demo below to see for yourself.  
The width of the "undesired" example maintains at its `max-width` even when the parent has shrunk smaller than that.

<div
  style={{
    backgroundColor: "var(--code-bg)",
    borderRadius: "4px",
    resize: "horizontal",
    animation: "3s ease-in-out infinite alternate resize",
  }}
>
<div><b> Desired behavior </b></div>
  <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
    <div style={{ flexGrow: 1, padding: "16px", minWidth: 0, maxWidth: "320px" }}>
      <div style={{ border: "1px dashed black", whiteSpace:"pre", overflow: "hidden" }}>
        <div>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit</div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div><b> Undesired behavior </b></div>
  <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
    <div style={{ flexGrow: 1, padding: "16px", maxWidth: "320px" }}>
      <div style={{ border: "1px dashed black", whiteSpace:"pre", overflow: "hidden" }}>
        <div>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br />

## Solution

The conditions for this problem are:

- The parent container uses `display: flex` or `display: grid`
- The immediate child uses `flex-grow: 1` as it wants to use as much width as it needs
- The content of the immediate child is not pure text

In the demo above, I'm only using text as the content of the child.
This would normally work fine, but it breaks in a more complex setup with nested children using different displays, or contains images etc.
To "emulate" this, I'm using `white-space: pre` in the demo to force text **not** to overflow into a new line.

For a `display: flex` parent, you can solve this by adding `min-width: 0` to the immediate child.
This is apparently necessary because `min-width: auto` is the default value.
In the context of a flexbox, this effectively means that `min-width = max-width`.

You can see all this in action from the demo above using your browser dev tools.

### Actual use case

If you're curious how this came about, I wrote the responsive tab component [here](https://mantine-salt.vercel.app/overflow-tabs-2).
