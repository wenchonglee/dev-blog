# About

I'm a Software Engineer based in Singapore. I primarily work as a front-end web developer, using React,
Typescript.

I dabble in DevOps and back-end too, with some experience in Kubernetes, Helm, Springboot(Java) and Oracle RDBMS.

## Current employment

Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies (CSIT), Singapore.

At CSIT, I lead the front-end development of an internal enterprise web app.  
Another responsibility I have is helping to architect the front-end solution of a project that is unifying multiple existing apps.
