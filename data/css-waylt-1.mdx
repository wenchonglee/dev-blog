# CSS - Why are you like this?

It is always a learning journey with CSS, as there are many "edge cases" and they are often infuriating to resolve.

> _Why does it behave this way? How could I have known this?!_

I chanced upon this unexpected behavior when I was trying to write a responsive tabs component.  
To be explicit, I want to design my component to:

- Grow as much as you need, up to your `max-width`
- But if your parent is smaller than your `max-width`, then your parent's `width` **is** your `max-width`

## Demo

Try resizing the demo below to see for yourself.  
The width of the "undesired" example maintains at its `max-width` even when the parent has shrunk smaller than that.

<div
  style={{
    backgroundColor: "var(--color-blockquote)",
    borderRadius: "4px",
    padding: "8px",
    overflow: "auto",
    resize: "horizontal",
  }}
>
<div><b> Desired behavior </b></div>
  <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
    <div style={{ flexGrow: 1, border: "1px solid white", padding: "16px", minWidth: 0, maxWidth: "320px" }}>
      <div style={{ border: "1px dashed black", whiteSpace:"pre", overflow: "hidden" }}>
        <div>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit</div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div><b> Undesired behavior </b></div>
  <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
    <div style={{ flexGrow: 1, border: "1px solid white", padding: "16px", maxWidth: "320px" }}>
      <div style={{ border: "1px dashed black", whiteSpace:"pre", overflow: "hidden" }}>
        <div>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Solution

The conditions for this problem are:

- The parent container uses `display: flex` or `display: grid`
- The immediate child uses `flex-grow: 1` as it wants to use as much width as it needs
- The content of the immediate child is not pure text
  - > _In the demo above, I'm only using text as the content of the child._  
    > _This would normally work fine, but it breaks in a more complex setup with nested children using different displays, or contains images etc._  
    > _To "emulate" this, I'm using `white-space: pre` in the demo to force text **not** to overflow into a new line._

For a `display: flex` parent, you can solve this by adding `min-width: 0` to the immediate child.
This is apparently necessary because `min-width: auto` is the default value.
In the context of a flexbox, this effectively means that `min-width = max-width`.

You can see all this in action from the demo above using your browser dev tools.

### Actual use case

If you're curious how this came about, I wrote the responsive tab component [here](https://mantine-salt.vercel.app/overflow-tabs-2).
